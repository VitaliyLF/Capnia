                      A Single-centered unblinded randomized controlled trial of
                      infants in the well-baby nursery to determine whether the
                      use of ETCOc with transcutaneous bilirubin (TCB) can
                      decrease the rate of first phototherapy within 7 days of
                      life (DOL) and whether it is associated with early
                      identification of infants who needed phototherapy. Trial

                      The intervention group received risk assessment based on
                      ETCOc: a&nbsp;level &lt; 1.5 ppm indicates low risk,
                      a&nbsp;level &ge; 1.5 ppm indicates increased risk for
                      hemolysis. Controls had empirical risk assessment
                      by&nbsp;pediatricians per local practice with ETCOc
                      masked.

                    <li>
                      The intervention was associated with decreased need of
                      phototherapy in 7 DOL by 23%.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      The intervention group started phototherapy earlier with
                      higher ETCOc level but similar TCB/TSB.
                    </li>
                    <li>No acute bilirubin encephalopathy occurred.</li>
                    <li>
                      Risk assessment by ETCOc (vs. empirical assessment per
                      local practice) can decrease the rate of unnecessary
                      phototherapy by 23%.

                    <li>
                      ETCOc may be able to identify those who require
                      phototherapy earlier.
