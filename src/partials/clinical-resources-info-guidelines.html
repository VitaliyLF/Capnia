                    <b>Focus of Guideline</b>
                    <p>
                      The overall aim of this guideline is to promote an
                      approach that will reduce the frequency of severe neonatal
                      hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy and
                      minimize the risk of unintended harm such as increased
                      anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, or unnecessary treatment
                      for the general population and excessive cost and waste.
                      Recent reports of kernicterus indicate that this
                      condition, although rare, is still occurring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Analysis of these reported cases of kernicterus suggests
                      that if health care personnel follow the recommendations
                      listed in this guideline, kernicterus would be largely
                      preventable.
                    </p>
                    <b>Identification of Hemolysis</b>
                    <p>
                      Because of their poor specificity and sensitivity, the
                      standard laboratory tests for hemolysis are frequently
                      unhelpful. However, end-tidal carbon monoxide, corrected
                      for ambient carbon monoxide (ETCOc), levels can confirm
                      the presence or absence of hemolysis, and measurement of
                      ETCOc is the only clinical test that provides a direct
                      measurement of the rate of heme catabolism and the rate of
                      bilirubin production. Thus, ETCOc may be helpful in
                      determining the degree of surveillance needed and the
                      timing of intervention. It is not yet known, however, how
                      ETCOc measurements will affect management.
